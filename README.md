# Google Books API

## Description

An application built to track books that are owned/read using the Google Books API.

This was ultimately a greatly unfinished project due to the time constraints of classwork and the sheer amount of time and work that I wanted to pour into the last project of the bootcamp. The intentions of this projects was you could open the application, search for books in the google books API, save them to your librar, or delete them as needed. I was able to route the Axios call and start calling the books, but never found the time to work in the displaying to books, or full CRUD functionality due to needing to prioritize what was going to help me most in completing the bookcamp and really being able to show off the depth of my skills in a focus on project 3 instead of a small book API app.

As practice later, I may return to still play with this idea and framework, but in terms of being able to truly polish my last project and huge focus for real portfolio usage, this project is incomplete.
